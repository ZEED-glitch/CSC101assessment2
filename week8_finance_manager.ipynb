        "Lines with no comma: The if len(parts) == 2: condition checks if the line splits into exactly two parts. If not, it means there isn't a comma separating the item and amount, or there are too many commas. In such cases, it prints a warning and skips the line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lines with non-numeric amounts: The try...except ValueError block around amount = float(parts[1].strip()) is designed to catch cases where the amount part cannot be converted into a floating-point number. This handles situations like 'Netflix,Fifteen'. It prints a warning and skips the line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Empty lines: The load_transactions function already filters out empty lines using if line.strip() before passing them to parse_transaction_line. If an empty line were to somehow reach parse_transaction_line, it would be caught by the if len(parts) == 2: condition as line.split(',') on an empty string results in [''], making len(parts) equal to 1, thus skipping it.\n",
